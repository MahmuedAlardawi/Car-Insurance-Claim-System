# Car Insurance Claim System - Project Overview

## Introduction
This project develops a Car Insurance Claim System for registering and processing insurance claims for car accidents. It handles dynamic data entry from text files, calculates claim amounts based on various conditions, and outputs detailed logs and reports.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Registration and Claim Processing**: Initiates by registering cars, owners, and insurance details from `inputCICSData.txt` and processes claims through `inputClaims.txt`.
- **Comprehensive Data Management**: Utilizes commands to add car details, owner information, and insurance coverage specifics into the system.
- **Advanced Claim Handling**: Processes claims considering premiums, special offers, and age-based adjustments.

## Technical Requirements

- **File I/O**: Manages input and output through specified file formats, ensuring accurate data storage and retrieval.
- **Conditional Logic**: Applies additional charges based on insurance type, special offers, and owner demographics.
- **Output Consistency**: Produces outputs exactly as specified in sample files, including logs and summary reports.

## Objective

To implement a robust system using object-oriented programming principles that manage and process insurance claims efficiently. This project demonstrates the practical application of file handling, class and object manipulation, and conditional logic in a real-world software solution.

## How to Use

- **Setup**: Load initial data using `inputCICSData.txt` for car, owner, and insurance information.
- **Operation**: Process claims using `inputClaims.txt` and review outputs in `ClaimInvoices.txt` and `CICSDatabase.txt`.

This README provides guidance on system setup and operation while abstracting specific details to ensure clarity and usability.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit different scenarios or expand the system's capabilities.
